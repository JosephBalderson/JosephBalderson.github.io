    <div id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Hello my name is Joseph Balderson, currently I am a student at Colorado State University Fort Collins. I am
            studying for my Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering. This program has given me multiple
            oportunities to learn new skills and information while applying them to different projects. This website is
            a portfolio of those projects.</p>

        <h2>Mech 200: Introduction to Manufacturing Processes </h2>
        <p>This calss teaches the basics of industry manufacturing. This includeds the reading of engineering drawings,
            material selection, manufactoring processes, and shop saftey. Also learning the basics of hand tools,
            cutting, grinding, lathing, milling as well as numerial control.</p>

        <h2>Mech 202: Engineering Design II </h2>
        <p>The engineering design process with emphasis on teamwork, ideation, decision-making, and project planning as
            applied to a group design project in mechanical engineering.
            Designed, built, and tested a projectile launcher that shot a cube, arrow, and ball accurately at a distance
            of 35, 75 and 105 feet. Developed a rapidly adjustable device that would accurately fire projectiles the
            required distances within the 3’x3’x3’ space requirement. Awarded First Place in the competition with over
            20 teams.</p>

        <h2>Mech 307: Mechatronics and Measurement Systems</h2>
        <p>Mechatronic and measurement system analysis and design; applied electronics; data acquisition;
            microcontroller interfacing and programming. This is an extension of ECE 204, where we learn the basics of
            electronics and learn more about PID tuning. This project was used to utilize these ideas and make an
            electrical or robotic project that had these controls. This project was the card dealer and used many things
            from what was learned in the class. This project was important for me to learn the value of making a
            mechatronics/electronics project. I ended up frying my laptop's mother board, and that was one of the most
            valuable lessons.</p>

        <h2>Mech 324: Dynamics of Machines</h2>
        <p>Dynamics of Machines is about the analysis and synthesis of moving machinery. The main focus of this class
            was 4-bar mechanisms. This uses the grashoff 4 bar equations to classify what kind of 4 bar is used. The
            project that I made was for a pill dispensor using a quick return mechanism. There are a lot of analytical
            calculations and iterative calculations that are done. To solve this, we use Matlab to solve the mechanisms,
            kinematics, and forces that are placed on the 4-bar.

        <h2>Mech 344: Heat and Mass Transfer</h2>
        <p>Heat and Mass Transfer is about the thermal transport properties of substances, conduction, convection,
            radiation, transient heat transfer, numerical methods, and heat exchangers. This project uses nodal heat
            transfer to solve two problems with Python. This also includes an in-class example, which I solved and
            included the professor's code.</p>
